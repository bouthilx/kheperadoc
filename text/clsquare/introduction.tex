\section{Introduction}

The maze plant inside \clsquare already procure a virtual environment to 
solve the maze problem. It was straightforward to customize it in order 
to command the \khepera throughout a maze. 
\\
\\
Once the detectors were built, I needed to pass the information from 
the detector to the plant. I built a wrapper around the maze definition 
to read the maze definition from the detector rather than from a static 
file. 
\\

In order to pilot the Khepera in the maze, I built a navigation class 
that takes $x$, $y$ coordinates in parameters and guides the robot with the 
help of an orientation detector.

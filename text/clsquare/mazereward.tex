\section{Maze reward (module)}

\subsection{Introduction}

If we use the plant as a reward module, the mainloop of CLsquare try to 
destroy 
the plant 2 times at the end of the «experiment». It tries to destroy 
the plant, and latter the reward module, but the reward module is the 
same as the plant, so the program crash because the plant is already 
destroyed. 

So I decided to build a dummy reward module. It returns reward 1 
whatever are the state and the action. It loads the maze from maze.def 
to know where is the goal so it can evaluate the function 
is\_terminal(current\_state).

\subsection{How to use}

Be sure that the maze definition file is named maze.def. The MazeKhepera
plant should do this by default. There is nothing to do other than this.

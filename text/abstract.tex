\begin{abstract}
This project was not a study, but the development of a plant and the 
required tools to command the Khepera robot in a physical environment. 
It is software development; the only results are the code itself and his 
functionalities. 
\\
\\
The main goal of this document is to provide a description of the tools 
and how to use them to drive the Khepera robot throughout a maze. 
Therefore, this is not a scientific report, but a manual. 
\\
\\
I really hope this project will be useful in the future. If any questions 
are left unanswered by this document, I will gladly answer them.

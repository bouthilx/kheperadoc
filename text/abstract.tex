\begin{abstract}
In this project, I developed a plant and the 
required tools to command the \khepera{} robot in a physical environment. 
\\
\\
The main goal of this document is to provide a description of the tools 
and how to use them to drive the Khepera robot throughout a maze. 
Therefore, this is not only the report of my project, but also an 
instruction manual. 
\\
\\
You will find here descriptions of two different types of detectors, 
the description of a simple navigation system for the Khepera and
the description of the maze plant customized for this project.
\\
\\
I really hope this project will be useful in the future. If any questions 
are left unanswered by this document, I will gladly answer them.

\section{Introduction}

The Tapir system is used to detect objects within images. I used 
it to detect the \khepera{} position and orientation and to build the 
discretized description of the maze as well. For the maze description, 
you can see it as the detection of all blocks (and their type) of the 
maze seen as a grid.

I first built a detector based on the histogram detector. This detector 
proved to be too unstable and difficult to manage when ambient light 
change. Because of this, I developed a simple color detector that 
proved to be more stable and manageable in this environment. 

Then, I developed a simple colored grid detector to discretize an image 
and get the mean color of each block. Based on this detector, I built 
the maze detector that is designed to detect more specifically given 
colors according to the maze definition (wall color, empty space color, 
etc). Finally, I built a module to output multiple objects over shared 
memory, as I needed this for the maze output.

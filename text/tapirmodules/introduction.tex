\section{Introduction}

The Tapir system is used to detect objects within images. I will use 
it to detect the Khepera III position and orientation and to build the 
discretized description of the maze as well. For the maze description, 
you can see it as the detection of every block (and their type) of the 
maze seen as a grid.

I first built a detector based on the histogram detector. This detector 
proved to be too unstable and difficult to manage when ambient lightning 
change. I then developed a simple color detector that proved to be more 
stable and easily manageable in this environment. 

Then, I developed a simple colored grid detector to discretize an image 
and get the mean color of each block. Based on this detector, I built 
the maze detector that is designed to detect more specifically given 
colors according to the maze definition (wall color, empty space color, 
etc). Finally, I built a module to output multiple objects over shared 
memory, as I needed this for the maze output.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Set starting positions in Maze.init.
        \item Set khepera\_tapir.cfg and tapir.cfg (maze).
        \item Set train.cls file, you can leave the plant part empty, 
            you do not want to train with the robot.
        \item Set with\_robot.cls file. Be sure that with\_robot=true is in 
            the Plant module.
        \item Start the maze detector.
        \item Start frameview in clsquare ./bin/frameview \&
        \item Start training with ./CLsquare train.cls
        \item When training is done, you can start experimenting with 
            Khepera. Before starting the experiment, be sure to have a 
            \clsquare{} running with manipulate.cls so you can stop the 
            robot if any problem arises. For example if \clsquare{} crash 
            or if the robot fall out of the maze. You should always 
            leave it running when you are experimenting with the 
            Khepera. (D,l0,l0 to stop the robot)
        \item When training is done, start the experiment with Khepera 
            with ./CLsquare with\_robot.cls
        \item When asked for, stop MazeDetector and start the detector 
            for the khepera.
        \item The Khepera should now be on his way to the target.

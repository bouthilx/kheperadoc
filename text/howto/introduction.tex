\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:howto:intro}

In this chapter I will briefly explain how to set up the tools and a 
maze for an experiment. I will first explain how to set up the maze 
and the maze detector. Then, I will explain how to set up the Khepera, 
you might have problems with the Bluetooth connections, this is 
sometimes the longest part to set up. Finally, I will explain how to 
run experiments with \clsquare{}.

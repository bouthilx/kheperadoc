\section{Maze}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find colors that are easy to detect. Typically black and 
            white for the walls and the free space, and a basic color 
            like red for the target. An easy way to build it is with red 
            and black tape on a white board.
        \item You can build the maze before, but it is easier too build 
            it while the detector is on, so you can keep track of how 
            well it is detected.
        \item Once the camera is placed above the maze, set the 
            xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax values using the arrows with the 
            MazeDetector to narrow down the subframe around the maze. 
            Be sure that the terminal as the focus. Print on screen the 
            value, write it down and save them in the configuration file.
        \item Use get\_block\_color functions to get the color values 
            (RGB) of the wall, the ground and the target. Wall and ground 
            colors are black and white by default.
        \item You can adjust the brightness and saturation values to get 
            better results
        \item You are now done with the maze
    \end{enumerate}
